# About the Monkey- Chatbot
## Intro
We can develop a chatbot that enables users to participate in random conversations or ask anonymous questions. The chatbot can analyze input and generate responses using different sources, such as OpenAI and other AI model providers. To safeguard users' privacy, we will not gather or retain any user-related data.
